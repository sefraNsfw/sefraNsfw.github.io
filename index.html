                        <h2>Initial work</h2>
                        <p class="text-justify">SEFRA – web based framework for searching Web content written in Serbian. SEFRA is an easily customizable hybrid solution that can be a platform for new search applications and/or a service for already existing ones. The proposed
                            architecture solves the problems of indexing, searching and displaying search results adjusted for Serbian. It unifies several web technologies and services into one product suitable for use in the Western Balkan’s countries
                            for helping e-Government citizens services and other public-sector services, private company administration, solving specific search problems for academic institutions and scientific literature publishers, etc. The proposed
                            solution uses advanced Serbian language services accessible over the Web. It is also implementable for any other language where the target language morphology service exists. In other words, architecture is also customizable
                            in this direction. It should be noted that the proposed architecture is optimized from both backend and web front-end perspective. The one application of the proposed architecture is experimentally demonstrated through the
                            search of crime law documents of Serbia. The experimental usage of this implementation shows that the problem of search relevance is well-solved and easily customizable.<br></p>
                        <h2>Future work </h2>
                        <p class="text-justify">Search &amp; Discovery Framework for finding not-safe-for-work textual content for Western Balkans languages (NSFW textual S&amp;D framework) The idea of the project is to provide software framework to be used for the development
                            of Search &amp; Discovery services for not-safe-for-work (NSFW) textual content in the Western Balkans language area. In contrast to the English language and other languages in Western Europe, in Eastern Europe, especially
                            in the Western Balkans, there are no advanced services for search &amp; discovery of textual content (especially not specialized for not-safe-for-work content). Our previous research work has brought framework SEFRA for Serbian
                            language search applications. This framework is open to community and can be adaptable for any specialized textual content types. Therefore, the idea of the project is to advance this framework in the direction of finding NSFW
                            textual content. We are also proposing framework extension in the direction of supporting search &amp; discovery of content written in other Western Balkans languages. After that, we are going to adapt the revised framework
                            for finding NSFW textual content in these Western Balkans languages. The proposed framework will be easily accessed and usable for any type of public or private digital service in Western Balkans area.</p><img class="img-fluid"
